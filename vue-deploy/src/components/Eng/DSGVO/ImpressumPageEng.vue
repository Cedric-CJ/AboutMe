        <h2>Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          The author has prepared and checked all information provided in his
          area to the best of his knowledge and belief. However, the author does
          not assume any warranty for the timeliness, correctness, completeness,
          or quality of the information provided. Liability claims against the
          author relating to damage of a material or non-material nature caused
          by the use or non-use of the information provided or by the use of
          incorrect or incomplete information are generally excluded, unless
          there is proven intentional or grossly negligent fault on the part of
          the author.
          All offers are subject to change and non-binding. The author
          expressly reserves the right to change, supplement, delete, or
          temporarily or permanently cease publication of parts of the pages or
          the entire offering without special notice.
        </p>

        <h2>References and Links (Disclaimer)</h2>
        <p>
          For direct or indirect references to external websites (“hyperlinks”)
          that lie outside the author’s area of responsibility, liability would
          only arise in the event that the author was aware of the content and
          it was technically possible and reasonable for the author to prevent
          use in the case of illegal content.
          The author expressly declares that at the time the links were set, no
          illegal content was discernible on the linked sites. The author has no
          influence on the current and future design, content, or authorship of
          the linked/connected pages. Therefore, the author hereby expressly
          distances himself from all content of all linked/connected pages that
          were changed after the link was set. This statement applies to all
          links and references set within the author’s own internet offering as
          well as to external entries in guest books, discussion forums, and
          mailing lists set up by the author. The provider of the page to which
          reference is made is solely liable for illegal, incorrect, or
          incomplete content and particularly for damage resulting from the use
          or non-use of such information provided, not the person who merely
          refers to the respective publication via links.

        <h2>Creation</h2>
        <p>
          This website was created by Cedric Jon Arnhold himself. Since he is
          still a student with limited experience, errors may occur,
          including legal ones.
