        <p><strong>1. Overview of Data Protection</strong></p>
        <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
        <p>
          Protecting your personal data is very important to us. We therefore
          process your data exclusively on the basis of legal provisions (GDPR,
          TMG). This privacy policy informs you about the most important aspects
          of data processing in the context of our website.

        <p><strong>Data Collection on this Website</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Data processing on this website is carried out by the website
          operator. You can find its contact details in the section “Information
          about the Responsible Party” in this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p>
        <p>
          We do not collect personal data from visitors to our website. The
          website functions entirely without the use of cookies or other
          tracking technologies.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not use any data for
          analytics or other purposes.
        </p>

        <p><strong>What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Because we do not collect or process any personal data, there is no
          need for data access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing,
          data portability, or the right to object. Should this change, we will
          inform you accordingly.

        <p><strong>2. Hosting</strong></p>
        <p><strong>We host our website with the following provider:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>GitHub Pages</strong></p>
        <p>
          GitHub Pages is a service of GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr.
          Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“GitHub”). When you visit our
          website, GitHub automatically collects certain data, such as your IP
          address, the type of browser used, and the operating system. For more
          information, please see
          <a

          >GitHub’s Privacy Statement</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of GitHub Pages is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, as we have a
          legitimate interest in ensuring the most reliable presentation of our
          website. Data processing is carried out exclusively by GitHub and
          includes the collection of technical data such as internet browsers,
          operating systems, or the time of page access. Consent is not required
          in this context, as we ourselves do not collect or store any personal
          data.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. General Information and Mandatory Details</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
        <p>
          The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
          very seriously. We do not collect any personal data ourselves. The
          collection and processing of technical data are carried out
          exclusively by our hosting service provider GitHub Pages and are
          subject to the statutory data protection regulations as well as this
          privacy policy.

          Since our website does not use cookies or other tracking technologies,
          we do not collect any personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when
          communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of
          data from access by third parties is not possible.
